From the **Employees** tab, attendance management begins by creating each employee's profile, which contains their key information: identity, position, department, hours, and work locations. This profile allows you to precisely associate the clocking and attendance records, ensuring reliable and personalized monitoring of attendance, lateness, and absences.

**2. View, Edit, and Delete an Employee**

From the Employees tab, you can easily edit or delete an employee.
