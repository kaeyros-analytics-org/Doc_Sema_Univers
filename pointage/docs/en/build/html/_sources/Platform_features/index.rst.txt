The data displayed reflects the columns in the Excel report: arrival and departure times, location, lateness, overtime, and balance.

You can also use the following options to search by employee name, filter by location, and switch between pages using the pagination menu.

**vi. View general reporting**
General reporting allows you to analyze employee attendance trends over an extended period (month, quarter, year). Unlike the daily dashboard, this view provides an overall summary to help assess punctuality and attendance at the company or department level.

1. From the **Main Dashboard**, click on the **View General Reporting** link.

============================

On this tab, you can view the employees registered in the company, add an employee, edit an employee's information, or delete an employee.

**i. Add an Employee**

By clicking the **Add Employee** button, a dialog box will open and you will enter the employee's name, phone number, email address, position, and department.

.. image:: ../images/image21.png

Note: For the phone number, make sure you enter the number exactly as it is entered on WhatsApp (for example, numbers without a 6 like 23789898989 and numbers with a 6 like 237689898989).

**ii. Viewing, Editing, and Deleting an Employee**

Everything works exactly as in the other cases. From the edit button, you can choose either the edit or delete option, depending on what you want to do.

.. image:: ../images/image22.png

Account Management
=========================

This is done in the **Company Space** tab. Only users with the Admin or Account Manager role can see this tab.

.. image:: ../images/image23.png

In this section, there are two main features: Add a New Company and Add a User.

**i. Add a company**

This feature allows you to create a new company to which you wish to sell the timekeeping tool. You must add the company here and add a user who will manage it.

By clicking the **Add Company** button, a dialog box will open and you must enter the information for the company you wish to add at this level.

.. image:: ../images/image24.png

.. image:: ../images/image241.png

You must enter the company name, the name of a company manager, the email address, and phone number of the company or company manager, then click the Confirm button to complete the company creation. You cannot create two companies with the same phone number.

**ii. View, edit, and delete companies.**

.. image:: ../images/image25.png

Once you create a company, it is automatically added to the list of companies, as shown in the image above. Using the edit button on the far right of each company, you can modify the company's information by clicking Edit or delete the company by clicking Delete.

Note: If you have the Account Manager role, you can only view and modify companies you have added. Therefore, you cannot modify a company added by the administrator or another user with the Account Manager role.

**iii. Add a User**

Generally, when you create a company, you need to add a user to that company who will manage it. You must grant them the Admin role.

In the User sub-tab, simply click the Add User button to trigger the process of adding a new user.

.. image:: ../images/image26.png

This will open a dialog box and you will need to fill in the various fields for this user.

.. image:: ../images/image27.png

It will be up to you to send these credentials to the user in question so they can access the platform to manage their business. These include their email address and password. Every user needs these two pieces of information to log in to the platform.

**i. View, edit, and delete a user.**

.. image:: ../images/image28.png

When you add a new user, they are automatically added to the user list, as shown in the image above. Using the edit button on the far right of each user, you can modify a user's information by clicking Edit or, if possible, delete them by clicking Delete.

NB: If you have the Account Manager role, you can only view and edit users you have added. Therefore, you cannot edit a user added by the administrator or another Account Manager.
