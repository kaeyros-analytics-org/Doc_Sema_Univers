Introduction
==============

Imagine that your company has two locations: one in Yaoundé and the other in Douala. After acquiring a license, you can deploy the time-tracking solution across your organization. Below are the steps to properly configure the tool. 

Step 1: Logging in to the Dedicated Platform
================================================

When you subscribe to the license, you will be provided with a personalized platform to manage your company. As an administrator, you must log in using your credentials. 

Step 2: Company Setup
========================================

Once logged in, go to the **Settings** tab to configure your organization:

* Create your two sites (Douala and Yaoundé).  
* Define the specific working hours for each site.  
* Add the various departments and positions in your company.  

Each employee must be assigned to a specific department and position.  

Step 3: Adding Additional Users
====================================================

You can then invite other users depending on their role:

* **Administrator**: Has the same rights as you on the platform.  
* **Account Manager**: Intended only for resellers. They can add companies and users but only have access to the **Account** tab.  
* **HR**: Has restricted access limited to the **Reporting** tab, allowing them to view attendance records only.

Step 4: Employee Registration
===========================================

* Add employees manually via the platform.  
* Ensure that each phone number matches **exactly** the one used on WhatsApp; otherwise, the time-tracking system will not function.  
* A feature to allow bulk import via Excel will be available soon. 

Step 5: On-site Implementation and Testing Phase
======================================================

* **Display the QR Code** at the entrance of each site (e.g., at reception) so that employees can easily scan and clock in.  
* **Inform and train employees** on how the system works.  
* Schedule a **test week** to train teams and confirm that the system is functioning correctly.
